# Welcome

Welcome to the GitHub home page for the IBM i2 Analyze distributed deployment example. The distributed deployment example demonstrates how to build a distributed deployment of i2 Analyze on multiple servers. To avoid the need for multiple physical servers, Docker is used to simulate the servers.

The distributed deployment example not only provides the environment for the deployment, but configures and deploys i2 Analyze across the servers in the same way that a system implementer does.

>**Important:** The distributed example uses a Docker environment to demonstrate a distributed deployment of i2 Analyze. The Docker environment is not designed to be used on customer sites for test or production systems. After you understand how the distributed deployment is deployed, you can replicate the deployment on physical servers.
